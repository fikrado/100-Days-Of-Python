python tuples = (1,2,3)
python dictonary = {1,2,3,}
python llist [1,2,3]
``````

tim.setheading(0)  
number_of_dots = 100  
  
for dot_count in range(1, number_of_dots + 1):  
 tim.dot(20, random.choice(color_list))  
 tim.forward(50)  
  
 if dot_count % 10 == 0:  
 tim.setheading(90)  
 tim.forward(50)  
 tim.setheading(180)  
 tim.forward(500)  
 tim.setheading(0)

# Day72

```
-   used `.groupby()` to explore the number of posts and entries per programming language
    
-   converted strings to Datetime objects with `to_datetime()` for easier plotting
    
-   reshaped our DataFrame by converting categories to columns using `.pivot()`
    
-   used `.count()` and `isna().values.any()` to look for NaN values in our DataFrame, which we then replaced using `.fillna()`
    
-   created (multiple) line charts using `.plot()` with a for-loop
    
-   styled our charts by changing the size, the labels, and the upper and lower bounds of our axis.
    
-   added a legend to tell apart which line is which by colour
    
-   smoothed out our time-series observations with `.rolling().mean()` and plotted them to better identify trends over time.
