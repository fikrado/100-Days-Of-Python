https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html


## different python datatype

``````
python tuples = (1,2,3)
python dictonary = {1,2,3,}
python llist [1,2,3]

tim.hideturtle()  
color_list = [(202, 164, 109), (238, 240, 245), (150, 75, 49), (223, 201, 135), (52, 93, 124), (172, 154, 40), (140, 30, 19), (133, 163, 185), (198, 91, 71), (46, 122, 86), (72, 43, 35), (145, 178, 148), (13, 99, 71), (233, 175, 164), (161, 142, 158), (105, 74, 77), (55, 46, 50), (183, 205, 171), (36, 60, 74), (18, 86, 90), (81, 148, 129), (148, 17, 20), (14, 70, 64), (30, 68, 100), (107, 127, 153), (174, 94, 97), (176, 192, 209)]  
tim.setheading(225)  
tim.forward(300)  
tim.setheading(0)  
number_of_dots = 100  
  
for dot_count in range(1, number_of_dots + 1):  
 tim.dot(20, random.choice(color_list))  
 tim.forward(50)  
  
 if dot_count % 10 == 0:  
 tim.setheading(90)  
 tim.forward(50)  
 tim.setheading(180)  
 tim.forward(500)  
 tim.setheading(0)
